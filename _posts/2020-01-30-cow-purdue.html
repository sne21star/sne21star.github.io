    <h2 class="section-heading">ABSTRACT</h2>

    <p align="justify">The Dairy Industry is a critical aspect of agriculture as it is a billion-dollar industry. 
    This industry makes the U.S. the world’s largest producer of dairy and beef products according to the United States Department of Agriculture. 
    Needless to say, cattle’s well-being is paramount to the survival of this industry. 
    However, contagious diseases pose a major threat and have been known to decimate infected animals from the healthy ones.
    Therefore, farmers must identify must be done in a quick and efficient manner. 
    One of the most efficient methods to solve this issue is Visual Analysis. This is because sick animals behave differently, and their behavior can be analyzed visually. 
    Therefore, to solve this problem I propose using Mask RCNN for this project.
    Mask RCNN is an object detection and instance seg- mentation method that is an extension of Faster RCNN.
