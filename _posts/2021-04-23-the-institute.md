Why I Chose It
-----------------
I was browsing on amazon for some new books to read for this year. This new year I had created a resolution to read one book per month. Immersed in my school work at Purdue University, I barely blocked out time to sit down and read a book for pleasure. During high school, it was one of my favorite things to do to relax. I could spend hours reading a captivating story until my eyes could no longer open and my brain could not process information. Now, after graduating, I decided to start this practice again. After browsing for some time, I thought I should first start with a book that was not part of a series, was suspensefully and highly rated so that I would A. Not be totally consumed into reading a series as I have much work to do still B. Would be entertained C. So I would get my money’s worth and all in all would continue this habit of reading. While casually scrolling I came across Stephen King's novel The Institute. During high school, I loved reading Stephen King’s novels such as The Shining, Doctor Sleep, Carrie, and even spent 6 months reading the novel IT. I decided I probably should start off my new year's resolution with this book as Stephen King has never let me down with his work. After clicking the link and reading the summary for this novelI scrolled down to read the reviews and saw many negative posts about his book–many angry at the political comments made in it. Naturally, I became hooked. However, after more research I found out that this book had been published in 2019 and went to the library to rent it instead. This way, even if I didn’t like the novel I could return it and start off the year with another book. After a couple of weeks, I finally was able to get a copy of the novel, and I started to read. 




Purpose

One of my new year resolutions was to read one book per month. In January I had read this book, and will write a post about this book.
