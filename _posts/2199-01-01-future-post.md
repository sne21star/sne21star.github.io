Future Blog Post
------

In this post I will talk about my project for the WWDC 2021 Swift Student Challenge. I will also talk about how I can improve on what I submitted. 



Purpose
------
I have been interested in application developement after working on it during my senior design class. I wanted to try to learn about swift further by creating a fun game.
