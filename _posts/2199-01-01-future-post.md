Future Blog Post
------

For the next post I am unsure as to what I will be writing about. I have many ideas in mind. But it will either be about the book I have recently finished: Red Rising, or it will be about my trip to the Peabody Essex Museum! 



Purpose
------
I am back on track to reading again! Yay!! Hope to be continue this resolution up since I haven't my June book. But hopefully I can read both June and July's book within July's month!
