<p>
    Engineering and engineers are very diverse. In ENGR 13100, you will begin to develop a wide variety of skills that will benefit you as a Purdue student and that you can build on as a practicing engineer. Topics covered include:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Develop code solutions that address engineering questions and follow professional programming standards.</li>
    <li>Understand and implement basic and intermediate programming structures: sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, and nested structures.</li>
    <li>Create adaptable, reusable programming routines.</li>
    <li>Read and apply flowcharts as a visual representation of a process.</li>
    <li>Analyze and model data using regression techniques.</li>
    <li>Make appropriate predictions using a mathematical model.</li>
    <li>Apply design ideas to programming solutions.</li>
    <li>Use evidence to evaluate, test, and optimize ideas and solutions.</li>
    <li>Communicate engineering concepts, ideas, and decisions effectively and professionally in diverse ways such as written, visual, and oral.</li>
    <li>Contribute to team products and discussions.</li>
