<h2 class="section-heading">ABSTRACT</h2>

<p align="justify">
    Detecting and recognizing text in a natural setting is a challenging task due to various shapes and unpredictable environment these texts are a part of. 
    Most methods have successfully detected text instances in an environment despite the environment’s complexity. 
    However, most methods assume the text instances are somewhat straight or in a linear format. 
    However, it is quite common to find text that is “curved” or non-linear in the real world. 
    Therefore, applying a text recognition model on the output of a text detection model using STN fails to achieve desired results. 
    Furthermore, even after detecting the text, one must rectify the text before feeding it into the text recognition model. 
    Therefore, I propose a method that combines a previous text detection model((Long et al., 2018)) with a text rectification algorithm: Thin Plate Spline (TPS) and a text recognition model((Bartz et al., 2018)) to identify curved text in natural settings.
