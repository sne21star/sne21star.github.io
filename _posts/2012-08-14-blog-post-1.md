Who Am I? 
======

Hello, my name is Sneha Mahapatra and I am recent graduate of Purdue University in computer engineering, with a minor in Mathematics and certificate in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. While majoring in Computer Engineering I learned a lot about the hardware side of computers. However, it was not until I started venturing into the world Artifical Intelligence and Computer Vision that my interest started to peak. It was in these fields my interest started to peak and I realized that my passion lied in Computer Science and I will be attending the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to omplete my masters in Computer Science.
