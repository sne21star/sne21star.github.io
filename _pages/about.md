Hello! My name is Sneha Mahapatra. I recently graduated from Purdue University with a BS in Computer Engineering, minored in Mathematics and Global Engineering, and recieved a certificate in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning as well as Software Engineering.

During my undergrad I worked with [Professor Reibman](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptPeopleListing?group_id=2571&resource_id=117177) and [Professor Zhu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~zhu0/) in a group called [Visual Analysis of Animal Behavior](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VADL/index.html) where I created a web GUI that allows research scientists to read data from an Object Tracking model in an intutitve way. 

For my Senior Design project, my team and I created a Real Time ASL translator application that can be used to translate ASL into English to help students at the Indiana School of Deaf learn English using Google's Mediapipe. [code](https://github.com/sne21star/mediapipe)

In my free time I love to read, play soccer, and sing!
