Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Engineering, Purdue University, December 2020

Work experience
======
* Synopsis, Lima Perú, Automation Engineer
* Summeer 2018 
  * Conducted research to identify appropriate software to use and applied my research using Katalon Studio and Appium
  * Developed Automated Test scripts to Test Web and mobile Application for Synopsis’s client

* Purdue University, VIP Researcher 
* Summer 2020, Spring 2020
    * Research team is VAA: Visual Analysis for Understanding Animal Behavior
    * Designed and developed a GUI for a research team that tracks turkey for poultry production
    * Abstract for my GUI was accepted to Purdue’s Undergraduate Research Conference.
    * Converted GUI to web application over the summer that is now interactive and intuitive that showcases 7 graphs which can interact with video data, 5 statistical graphs, an animation that tracers the turkey’s path, and a tab that showcase ML model used to track turkeys

Engineering Projects 
======
* Senior Design: EPCS 412: 
    * Designed and developed a Real Time ASL translator application that uses Computer Vision to translate American Sign Language (ASL) for Senior Design. This project included the following:
        * Designed and developed an application that integrated Mediapipe and ASL translator model that can be used by students at the Indiana School of Deaf. Application integrates a static sign ASL translator tailored to the Indiana Sign Language.
        * Fined tuned an existing ML Model and integrated it with Google’s Mediapipe software framework to interpret the ASL Alphabet.
        * This application has nine different categories and also has a dynamic sign translator that can translate phrases in ASL alphabet.
* Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras (CAM2): 
    * Research team that revolves around using worldwide cameras and interpret data from the Cameras
    * Currently working on how to use the cameras to aid in the COVID-19 crisis by tracking those who wear masks or not.
    * Designed and developed web scraper that could parse different live cameras for information about the public and be used to decipher mask wearing.
* ECE 57000 (Graduate Level AI Course): Fall 2020
    * Increased Accuracy of Text Recognition Model by modifying Text Rectification process.
    * Rewrote Thin Plate Spline Algorithm to straighten curved text found in natural settings before running Text Recognition Model
    * Increased accuracy of Text Recognition Model from 0.00% to 42.08%
* Pulse Oximeter Project (ECE 362): Spring 2018
  * Designed a Pulse Oximeter using the MAX 30100 sensor and an STM 32 microcontroller
  * Responsible for creating Program that detected IR signals and converted them to the actually values for heartbeat and SP02 levels.
